Not directly related to the project, just something interesting I noticed. Each TCGA sample is run through four different variant calling pipelines resulting in four vcf files with variant positions for each patient. If each variant caller were perfectly accurate, we'd expect these four lists to be identical, but perhaps unsurprisingly, the lists show low concordance. The degree of agreement between the four pipelines (which I call ‘concordance’) can give us insights into caller accuracy, and tumor intrinsic properties which might compromise accuracy. This is useful since it is very difficult to test variant callers (we don’t know the ground truth of real data, and simulated data is often unrealistic).
